Fluid Twitter
===============

A Userscript for Fluid that streamlines the twitter interface to
make it usable in a flexible (but mostly thin) Fluid instance


Installation
===============
(Assuming you've already downloaded Fluid from Fluidapp.com)

1.  Create a new Fluid SSB
 -- URL: http://twitter.com/home (you could also use http://twitter.com/username, but home will redirect you to the login as necessary)
2.  Run the Fluid SSB you just created
3.  In the menu, navigate to Userscripts -> Open Userscripts Folder
4.  Paste fluid_twitter.user.js into the SSB's Userscript folder
5.  In the menu of your SSB navigate to Userscripts -> Reload All Userscripts
6.  Navigate to Userscripts -> Fluid Twitter to toggle it's enablement (is that a word?)
7.  Use Cmd-R to reload SSB window

You Win!

Optional
===============
8.  Open Twitter -> Preferences.
9.  Go to tab Userstyles.
10. Click the plus
11. Assign the URL Pattern to "*twitter.com/home*" and check the box
12. Paste in the contents of user-style.css

You Win!

Caveats
===============
* As of FluidInstance 0.8.2, SSB's will not persist the enablement of your Userscripts. Translation: you will have to enable Fluid Twitter every time you open your SSB

TODO
===============
* Have Fluid Twitter to a JSON request to see if your friends timeline has been updated before reloading the window. This will require a way to persist username (and possibly password).
